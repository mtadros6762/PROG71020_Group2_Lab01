//Write a function called multiply that has three int arguments
//multiply(int, int, int). The last argument should have a default
//value = 1. The function returns the product of the three numbers.

//a. Add another function that has the same name and has only two 
//arguments multiply(double, double)

//b. Can you add another third function that has the same name and
//has two arguments: multiply(int, int) and call it as follows
//multiply(2, 3)? Why or why not?
//This is not possible
//.....

//c. Test your functions using the main function code. Do not change the
//provided main function


using namespace std;

int main() {

	// ** Question-4 **

	cout << "\nQuestion-4: \n";

	cout << "The product of 4 * 15 * 7 is " << multiply(4, 15, 7) << endl;

	cout << "The product of 0.5 * 4.5  is " << multiply(0.5, 4.5) << endl;

	// b.Can you add another third function that has the same name and has two arguments: multiply(int, int)
	// and call it as follows multiply(2, 3)? Why or why not? Add your answer as a comment in your code. (1 pt.).
